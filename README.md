# Steps to add test to this project

- [x] Clone GitHub - `FedericoAmura/Agile2020AccountingNotebook`
- [x] Add `Cypress` and `Cucumber` to the project
- [x] Create a test input JSON file in the project for your tests
- [x] Check the postman collection at backend/tests and write an API test with Cypress to post (validate the responses):
  - [x] 1 credit transaction
  - [x] 2 debit transactions
  - [x] 1 invalid transaction
  - [x] write an API test to check the account balance

- [x] write an e2e test with Cucumber that:
  - [x] opens the app UI
  - [x] go to the 2nd debit transaction
  - [x] get amount and date:
  - [x] compare the amount with the test input value used by the previous test
  - [x] compare the date with todayâ€™s date

# Run the Test
- Go to root of the application and run the project `$ npm run start`
- Then run the Cypress test with `$ npm run cypress:run` or `$ npm run cypress:open` to run manually.

# Result
