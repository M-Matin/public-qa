# Accounting Notebook

This repository is web application made with ReactJS and NodeJS. Both technologies use Typescript as the programming language.

# Backend
Backend is an express server with Typescript and it is at `backend` directory.

Typescript source code is in src folder.

- `index.ts` file is the main entry point. It will load the complete application.
- `models` directory define entities.
- `server` is the express creation module.
- `sevices` handle business logic.

The tests are in `test` directory. They can be checked runnning `npm run test` at backend directory.

### Concurrency solution
For the case of race conditions, where a transaction is written while some requests are trying to read, coordination of readers and writers, with writing priority has been implemented. It is completely contained in `Account` class (altough, considering that NodeJS executes JS in a single thread it is not really necessary until a database or file saving system is added)

### Postman
A postman collection is at backend/tests if manual testing is desired.

# Frontend
Frontend is a ReactJS application written in Typescript. It is just a simple component that retrieves the transaction list from backend and displays it on the main page.
Components were written with Storybook, and Material Design basic components have been used.

# Installation, testing & running
For instalation NodeJS is needed. Every command is relative to the main directory of the project.

Dependencies are included in repository so no extra installation might be required. They were installed using node 14.13.1 in a x86_64 ubuntu 20.04 system. Compatibility issues might emerge if using a different setup, if that's the case, delete `frontend/node_modules` and `backend/node_modules` folders and run the following commands.
- To install backend dependencies run `npm install` at backend
- To install frontend dependencies run `npm install` at frontend

- To check backend tests run `npm run test` at backend

- To start backend run `npm run dev` at backend
- To start frontend run `npm run start` at frontend

- To start both systems with only one command, at root, run `npm run start` at root directory.
